# jcifs-secure-netlogon

A fork of jcifs-ng to be reusable in the implementation of the Secure NETLOGON protocol update Microsoft enforced after the ZEROLOGON hack.

This is one of the 2 building blocks needed to implement Secure NETLOGON in Java.

The other one is our fork of the base LifeRay NETLOGON implementation.

See the jcifs-ng project for details.
